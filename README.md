# Depth-Nerf
This repository contains an implementation of a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) model trained to predict depth from provided depth maps. The model's architecture is based on the Tiny NeRF model outlined in the research paper by Mildenhall et al. ([GitHub Repository Link]([https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository](https://github.com/bmild/nerf/blob/master/tiny_nerf.ipynb))).
Dataset: Includes preprocessed RGB images, camera poses, and focal length data.

#### How to Run
Open and execute the notebook Depth-NeRF.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
